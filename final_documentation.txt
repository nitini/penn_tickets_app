Working on our Web App was quite a bit of fun, and we learned quite a bit about how to use python in this process, as well as quite a bit of CSS styling. In terms of our proposal, we accomplished the goals that we had originally thought feasible. With that being said, there is still plenty of room for improval in this project. And one of us plans to continue working on it over the summer in the hopes of turning it into a real service here at Penn.
